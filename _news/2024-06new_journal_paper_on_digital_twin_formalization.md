#### Abstract

The transformation to Industry 4.0 also transforms the processes of developing
intelligent manufacturing production systems. Digital twins may be employed to
advance the development of these new (embedded) software systems. However,
there is no consensual definition of what a digital twin is. In this paper, we
provide an overview of the current state of the digital twin concept and
formalize the digital twin concept using the Object-Z notation. This
formalization includes the concepts of physical twins, digital models, digital
templates, digital threads, digital shadows, digital twins, and digital twin
prototypes. The relationships between all these concepts are visualized as
class diagrams using the Unified Modeling Language. Our digital twin prototype
approach supports engineers in the development and automated testing of complex
embedded software systems. This approach enables engineers to test embedded
software systems in a virtual context without the need of a connection to a
physical object. In continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines,
such digital twin prototypes can be used for automated integration testing and,
thus, allow for an agile verification and validation process. In this paper, we
demonstrate and report on the application and implementation of a digital twin
using the example of two real-world field studies (ocean observation systems
and smart farming). For independent replication and extension of our approach
by other researchers, we provide a laboratory study published open source on
GitHub.
