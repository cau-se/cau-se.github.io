#### Abstract

Better software drives better research, a fundamental principle in the research software engineering community. Similarly, better architecture underpins better software, a core belief in the software engineering research community. Therefore, we advocate and emphasize the importance of designing robust architectures for research software to elevate the quality of research outcomes, and illustrate this with two case studies.
