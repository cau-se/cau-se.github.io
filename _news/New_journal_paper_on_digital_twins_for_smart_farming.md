### New paper in the journal _Symmetry_

**Barbie, Alexander, Wilhelm Hasselbring, and Malte Hansen. 2024. "Digital Twin Prototypes for Supporting Automated Integration Testing of Smart Farming Applications" _Symmetry_ 16, no. 2: 221. [https://doi.org/10.3390/sym16020221](https://doi.org/10.3390/sym16020221)**

#### Abstract

Industry 4.0 marks a major technological shift, revolutionizing manufacturing
with increased efficiency, productivity, and sustainability. This
transformation is paralleled in agriculture through smart farming, employing
similar advanced technologies to enhance agricultural practices. Both fields
demonstrate a symmetry in their technological approaches. Recent advancements
in software engineering and the digital twin paradigm are addressing the
challenge of creating embedded software systems for these technologies. Digital
twins allow full development of software systems before physical prototypes are
made, exemplifying a cost-effective method for Industry 4.0 software
development. Our digital twin prototype approach mirrors software operations
within a virtual environment, integrating all sensor interfaces to ensure
accuracy between emulated and real hardware. In essence, the digital twin
prototype acts as a prototype of its physical counterpart, effectively
substituting it for automated testing of physical twin software. This paper
discusses a case study applying this approach to smart farming, specifically
enhancing silage production. We also provide a lab study for independent
replication of this approach. The source code for a digital twin prototype of a
PiCar-X by SunFounder is available open-source on GitHub, illustrating how
digital twins can bridge the gap between virtual simulations and physical
operations, highlighting the symmetry between physical and digital twins.
