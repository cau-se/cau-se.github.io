### The Kieker Observability Framework will be presented at ICPE 2025

With the latest inclusion of the Kieker Observability Framework in the SPEC RG
repository,[^0] Shinhyung is provided with an opportunity to present Kieker in
three different sessions at the upcoming ICPE 2025.[^1]

* **Artifact HandsOn** will give the participants a hands-on experience of the
  Kieker Observability Framework, through our tool artifact and trace analysis.
  The session is scheduled on Tuesday, May 6, 2025 at 14:00 h.

* **Poster Presentation** will be held on Friday, May 9, 2025 at 12:30 h,
  during the lunch break. ICPE participants will be able to see the live
  demonstration of our tool artifact on a laptop along with the poster.
  * [ICPE2025 Poster-Kieker Observability Framework](/assets/pdf/ICPE2025-Poster-KiekerObservabilityFramework.pdf)

* **Pitch Presentation** will be held on Friday, May 9, 2025 at 14:00 h, as a
  5-minute talk. [^2]

The hands-on tool artifact is available in three formats: (1) Docker images on
the Docker Hub registry with the Docker compose scripts on GitHub[^3], (2) a
single archive file of all Docker image exports,  and (3) a single virtual
machine image that runs the tool artifact automatically at the start-up. (2)
and (3) are uploaded to Zenodo.[^4] You may obtain the proceedings paper from ACM[^5] or a preprint from arXiv.[^6]
